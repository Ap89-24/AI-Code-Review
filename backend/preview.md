The function `sum()` as you've written it:

```javascript
function sum() {
  return a + b;
}
```

will likely cause a **`ReferenceError: a is not defined`** (or `b is not defined`) if you try to execute it as is.

This is because `a` and `b` are not defined within the scope of the `sum` function, nor are they passed in as arguments. JavaScript won't know what `a` and `b` refer to.

Here are the common ways you'd typically write a `sum` function, depending on your intent:

---

### 1. **Passing Parameters (Most Common & Recommended)**

This is the standard way. You pass the numbers you want to sum directly to the function as arguments.

```javascript
function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

// How to use it:
console.log(sum(5, 3));  // Output: 8
console.log(sum(10, -2)); // Output: 8
```

---

### 2. **Summing an Arbitrary Number of Arguments (using `...rest` parameter)**

If you want to sum *any* number of values (not just two), you can use the rest parameter (`...`). This collects all arguments into an array, which you can then iterate over or use `reduce`.

```javascript
function sumAll(...numbers) {
  // 'numbers' will be an array like [1, 2, 3, 4]
  return numbers.reduce((accumulator, currentValue) => accumulator + currentValue, 0);
}

// How to use it:
console.log(sumAll(1, 2, 3));         // Output: 6
console.log(sumAll(10, 20, 30, 40));  // Output: 100
console.log(sumAll(5));               // Output: 5
console.log(sumAll());                // Output: 0
```

---

### 3. **Summing Numbers in an Array**

If you have your numbers already in an array, you can pass the array to a function and sum its elements.

```javascript
function sumArray(numbers) {
  if (!Array.isArray(numbers)) {
    console.error("Input must be an array.");
    return 0; // Or throw an error
  }
  return numbers.reduce((accumulator, currentValue) => accumulator + currentValue, 0);
}

// How to use it:
const myNumbers = [10, 20, 30, 40];
console.log(sumArray(myNumbers)); // Output: 100

console.log(sumArray([1, 2, 3]));  // Output: 6
```

---

### 4. **Using Global Variables (Generally Discouraged)**

While technically possible, this approach is usually not recommended for functions like `sum` because it makes the function dependent on external state, reducing its reusability and making code harder to understand and debug.

```javascript
let a = 10;
let b = 20;

function sumGlobal() {
  return a + b;
}

// How to use it:
console.log(sumGlobal()); // Output: 30

// If you change a or b, the function's output changes:
a = 5;
b = 5;
console.log(sumGlobal()); // Output: 10
```

---

**In most cases, you'll want to use method 1 (passing two parameters) or method 2 (using the rest parameter for multiple numbers).** They make your function self-contained, predictable, and easy to reuse.
